## 🌟 About Me

I engineer **end-to-end intelligent systems** — from raw data to deployed AI applications.

        Data → Statistical Analysis → Feature Engineering → ML/DL Modeling → Optimization → Deployment


I combine strong mathematical foundations with hands-on engineering experience in:

- Machine Learning pipelines  
- Deep Learning & Computer Vision  
- Model optimization & generalization  
- Full-stack ML deployment (Flask / Streamlit / Hugging Face)  

I don’t just train models — I design systems that work in production environments.
